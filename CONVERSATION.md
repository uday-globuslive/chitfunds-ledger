# ChitFunds Ledger - Development Conversation

## Initial Request

**User**: I want to create a chitfunds ledger where user can login and provide his multiple chitfunds deposits and track how much he paid and every time user paid, he will upload the payment snapshot and it should save to the details. Add any more options you feel useful. Login should be from register page and it should be approved by admin user from mongodb cloud I will approve login. Or user should get mail confirmation code to get it approved. Create the project in django. And provide me steps to deploy in the pythonanywhere also. Database should be mongodbcloud, which I will provide details to connect. Provide me steps to configure that also.

**Response**: Created the complete Django project with MongoDB integration, user authentication, payment tracking, and receipt uploads.

## Free Hosting Options

**User**: Can you provide free options available to host multiple django websites?

**Response**: Here are some free options for hosting multiple Django websites:

1. **PythonAnywhere** - Free tier includes 1 web app, but you can run multiple Django sites as subapplications under one domain

2. **Heroku** - Free tier for hobby projects (though with sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity)

3. **Render** - Free tier with some limitations but generous for small projects

4. **Vercel** - Free tier supports Django deployment with some limitations

5. **Fly.io** - Free tier includes small shared VMs that can host multiple Django apps

6. **Railway** - Limited free tier that can run small Django projects

7. **Oracle Cloud Free Tier** - Always free VMs where you can host multiple Django sites with proper configuration

Most free tiers have limitations on usage, database size, or require occasional restarting. For completely free options, Oracle Cloud and PythonAnywhere offer the most flexibility for running multiple sites.
